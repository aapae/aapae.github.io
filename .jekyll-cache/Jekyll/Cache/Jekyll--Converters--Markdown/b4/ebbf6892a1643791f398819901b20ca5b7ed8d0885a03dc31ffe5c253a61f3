I"â*<p>Human research is important. It is necessary if we as a society are to overcome illness and disease. Illness and disease are understood through its study, as are interventions which may impact upon it such as medications, devices and gene transfers. Early research ideas involving these new â€˜agentsâ€™ are typically tested in laboratories, often on cells, and then in animals (usually flies, mice, primates, and dogs). Invariably however there comes a time in clinical research when the progression of a study aiming to understand the effects of the novel â€˜agentâ€™ on a particular human condition, must be tested in human beings [1, 2].</p>

<p>These studies are known as â€˜early phaseâ€™ or â€˜first-in-humanâ€™ studies (EPR) and they constitute the vast majority, some 61%, of all human studies [3].</p>

<p>The primary objective of these early experimental studies is to test agents for their safety in human beings. They are not designed to be of any direct benefit to participants. Furthermore, published data of results of toxicity in EPR show that significant potential for harm should be expected. In general because of the grave level of uncertainty, often EPR is undertaken with participants with lifelimiting or lifethreatening disease or conditions. Often these participants have advanced, refractory illness, that is, all conventional treatment options have been exhausted [3-5]. As noted by Kimmelman, this preference for participants with refractory, advanced illness is sometimes referred to as the â€˜oncology modelâ€™ of subject selection because â€˜oncology phase I trials almost universally enroll such patientsâ€™ [3, p. 32]. The preference for limiting exposure to risk to those volunteers already facing certain death illustrates the great uncertainty of predicting risks in early phase research. Ultimately however, the uncertainty is immeasurable.</p>

<p>Due to the rarity of disease in children, and the lack of generalisability of results from adult studies, there is a strong research culture among pediatric clinicians [6]. This extends to include EPR [3, 6, 7]. This strong research culture has contributed to an increased likelihood that children will survive serious disease, and within the oncology setting has led to an improved five year survival rate from 20% thirty years ago, to 75% (in part also due to improvements in supportive care) [6, 8, 9]. Although researchers and paediatric clinicians employ a number of strategies to reduce harm, published data of results of toxicity in research show 17-50% of children in phase I studies experience doselimiting toxicities, 21% of children are hospitalised due to research induced toxicities, 5% of phase I studies are discontinued due to toxicity, and approximately 0.4-2.7% of children may die a toxic death [10, 11]. The recognition of potential for harm is also demonstrated in studies of attitudes of paediatric clinicians involved in research on children [10-13]. Estlin et al. found the greater majority of paediatric clinicians (71%) involved in early phase research expected a child to have a least a 50% chance of experiencing toxicity by participating, with the perceived risk of a lifethreatening toxicity estimated at 40%, and the estimated risk of a child dying from toxicity at 16% [12, 13]. In comparison to the potential for risk, few studies adequately capture participant benefit with suggested potential for benefit remaining as low as 2% [14, 15]. In part, this may be due to the lack of a consistent, generalisable standard as what counts as a â€˜benefitâ€™ [15].</p>

<p>The nature of EPRâ€”including the limited potential for benefit and significant potential for harmâ€”raises significant implications for the consent process. Parents of child participants must understand and fully comprehend the uncertainty of EPR involvement. However, as noted by de Vries and colleagues, the strong culture of research among paediatric clinicians raises ethical concerns as the boundaries between clinical research and clinical care become more blurred [6]. This is particularly the case for parents who are tasked with making decisions about the care of their dying child in a very emotionally charged environment [16, 17]. Decision-making under these circumstances is fraught with difficulty for three main reasons: (a) there may be a lack of a clear, knowable distinction between the roles of researcher and treating clinician; (b) parents may be unaware or fail to understand that the primary nature of research and the primary nature of clinical care are different, and (c) parents may simply be unable to accept that the demise of their child is inevitable. These key issues may cause parents to overestimate the likelihood of benefit for their child, underestimate the likelihood of harm, and falsely attribute therapeutic values and expectations, a phenomenon known as a â€˜therapeutic misconceptionâ€™ [17-19]. This discrepancy in understanding or awareness of the true nature and prospects of EPR enables the construction of an altered reality of clinical research participation from that which the parent is actually consenting. Indeed, some parents enrol their child in early phase research under the mistaken belief it is another form of conventional treatment [20-22] .</p>

<p>A doctoral research project is currently being undertaken by the Center for Health and Society, and the Melbourne Medical School (University of Melbourne) which considers the ethical implications for the consent process when parents who hold therapeutic misconceptions agree for their child to take part in EPR. The study will also consider whether the existence of therapeutic misconceptions invalidates consent under current Australian laws.</p>

<p>Primarily the justification for the study is a concern that any therapeutic misconceptions about research participation, as perceived by the parents of child participants, may impact on their ability to deliberate and make a meaningful, valid decisions about their childâ€™s involvement in EPR [23, 24]. This is particularly the case for parents deliberating about enrolling children with refractory disease in experimental clinical studies that may involve limited potential for benefit but great potential for uncertain risks and harms.</p>
