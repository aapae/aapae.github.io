<p>Infertility is increasingly common in the modern world, in both men and women. Technology is advancing so that IVF and artificial insemination are more accessible than ever â€“ but at what cost? This event will not only examine the science of IVF, but also sociocultural aspects, and importantly, the ethics. Will we soon be able to design our babies? This event will provide an interesting look into the present and all-important future of IVF. Indemnity and insurance will also be tantamount to this event.</p>

<p>(A combined event with the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Society (O&amp;G Soc).)</p>
