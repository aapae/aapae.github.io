I"<p>Dear AAPAE members,</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest edition of the Australian Ethics!</p>

<p>In correspondence with one of my learned colleagues in the UK, a highly regarded Professor of Professional Ethics in Pharmacy, Professor Wingfield wrote a line that made me reflect. She wrote: ‚ÄúIt is sad‚Ä¶ academia is so limited in their understanding of concepts of professionalism.‚Äù</p>

<p>Concepts of professionalism are indeed difficult to construct and convey in academia. They are neither philosophical nor scientific, but perhaps a blend of both. Application of ethical principles onto a scaffolding of professional values and practices is a challenge, whatever specific profession is under analysis.</p>

<p>This is why the Australian Association for Professional and Applied Ethics is such a unique, special Association. Our very title reflects the importance of the application of moral theory in the context of professional practice. Not just the rhetoric or the logical reasoning of philosophical analysis. Nor is it a reflection of a scientific approach to a problem, with well defined rules to follow and clear outcomes and conclusions.</p>

<p>Professional ethics has deeper, more meaningful implications. Look at any news article in today‚Äôs papers. You will find the notion of professional ethics at the core of so many problems in professions such as politics, journalism and economics for example. Some fundamentally disturbing contemporary issues in professions such as these have caused major societal concern lately, with long term implications on trustworthiness, reliability and transparency. For example, ethics in journalism is today under great scrutiny in the aftermath of the Rupert Murdoch saga. One incident of ‚Äòphone hacking‚Äô unraveled into an almost unbelievable series of events and exposure. What was missing? Professional ethics. A moral compass in the context of professional practice.</p>

<p>The Australian Association for Professional and Applied Ethics is concerned with such issues and a broad range of other issues in the context of professional practice. These issues shape our lives, influence our decision making, and make us more responsible human beings. Highlighting issues of professional and applied ethics to the public that are important to you and your profession, sharing your analysis and recommendations are all part of being a member of this Association. And where better to convey your message than at the annual conference?</p>

<p>This edition of Australian Ethics comes to you just before our 19th annual conference, in Brisbane, which I urge you all to attend. Come and join us for a great program of invited speakers and contributed papers; and for what can only be described as an enchanting river cruise for the conference dinner.</p>

<p>Located within the University of Queensland campus, St John‚Äôs College is situated in a garden setting, providing both a beautiful and practical conference location. The conference convenor, Reverend Professor John Morgan, has lined up an exciting selection of events, papers and guest speakers under the theme of:</p>

<p>####Ethics, Values and Civil Society - Ethical, Historical, Professional and Political Perspectives###</p>

<p>We will also be honoring some long standing founding members of the AAPAE at the conference this year. All this, with new opportunities to publish papers submitted to the conference to be announced, will make the effort to attend this conference worth your while.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Executive Committee, I look forward to seeing you all in Brisbane in June.</p>
