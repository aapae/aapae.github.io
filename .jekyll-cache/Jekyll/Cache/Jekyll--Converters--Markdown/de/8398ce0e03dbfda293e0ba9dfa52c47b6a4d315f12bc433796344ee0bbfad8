        <p>Subsequent to last year’s successful introduction of a dedicated workshop for PhD students at the annual ABEN conference, we are pleased to hold a similar workshop at the 2015 ABEN Conference. In this session PhD participants will have an opportunity to meet with senior scholars, discuss their research and ask questions related to issues beyond their dissertation (such as managing the supervisory relationship, communicating ideas, how to find and work with co-authors, understanding reviewing and publishing processes). The workshop will also provide the students an opportunity to meet with other students undertaking research in the field of Business Ethics.</p>
