Larelle Bossi has a passion for all things oceans and a commitment to ensure her children, and future generations will enjoy an ocean culture as she does.  Avoiding the reductive terminology, she is often most critical of (ie: “knowledge broker”), Larelle often identifies as a philosopher within a transdisciplinary space.  Her brand of biocultural ethics works alongside Eco-feminism and First Nations kinship worldviews.  Her work involves contemporary issues of climate change, ocean cultures, resource and environmental management, ocean ethics, and the development of ethical cultures, leadership and investment.  

Larelle is a Research Fellow at the Institute of Ethics, Law and Governance at Griffith University, working on the Blue Economy CRC; an Industry Fellow (Climate) with the College of Business and Economics at the University of Tasmania; a member of the Centre for Marine Socioecology and a Principal Consultant for Vanico in her ‘spare time’. 

... and less seriously, she is an award-winning director that still from time to time may be seen within the film and theatre worlds ...
