Peter's career expertise is in institutional analysis and strengthening. Formerly Professor of Administrative Studies at the University of Manchester, he has worked for and consulted to a number of major organisations, including the World Bank and the United Nations, as well as the governments of several countries, including Australia. His work interests over recent years, in both theory and practice, have been concerned with the institutional implications of moral behaviour in different organisational environments.
