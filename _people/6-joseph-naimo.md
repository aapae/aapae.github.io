Joseph recently retired after seventeen years of service as a Senior Lecturer in Philosophy and Postgraduate Ethics at the University of Notre Dame Australia. Joseph now devotes his time in the service of both the disability and mental health sectors engaging, consulting, and advocating for change to address misguided abuse and neglect among other questionable practices occurring within these sectors. As a father of a young man living with autism, Joseph brings much experience and passion to the table to address broad scale systemic issues plaguing these sectors.
