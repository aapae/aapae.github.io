Hugh is a postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Ethics, Governance and Law at Griffith University. His PhD work in political philosophy at the University of Queensland researched the ways natural rights limit intellectual property. His current research focuses on philosophical issues in international relations, international law and the protection of civilians, as well as continuing research on the nature of rights, especially security, intellectural and property rights, as well as various topics in applied ethics. His first book, Intellectual Liberty: Intellectual Property, will be published in December, 2012, by Ashgate. His 2009-2012 publications include articles in top law, philosophy, ethics and international policy journals, including The Modern Law Review, The Philosophical Quarterly, Social Theory and Practice, and Global Responsibility to Protect.
