Cliff holds PhDs in philosophy from University of Warwick (where he was a Commonwealth Scholar) and University of Western Australia, together with qualifications in economics, industrial relations, and human resources management. His academic interests centre on American Pragmatism, particularly application of pragmatist principles to ‘real world’ contemporary issues in management, self-development, and education. In addition to his academic work, Cliff has been an Officer in the Royal Australian Air Force and a management consultant with Boston Consulting Group, and has held senior management roles in logistics, procurement, HR and IT with Qantas Airways, Campbell Soup Company/ Arnott’s Biscuits, and BHP. 

His current research interests include philosophy of management, contextualist business ethics, applied pragmatist philosophy, and the philosophical psychology of William James. His new book on James’s therapeutic ethical pragmatism will be published by SUNY Press later this year.
