The 2024 AAPAE Symposium will be held via Zoom on the 5th of December 2024!

In a 2024 report on Generative AI and the future of work, the International Monetary Fund reported that:

> Almost 40 percent of global employment is exposed to AI, with advanced economies at greater risk but also better poised to exploit AI benefits than emerging market and developing economies. In advanced economies, about 60 percent of jobs are exposed to AI, due to prevalence of cognitive-task-oriented jobs.” Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work. (n.d.). IMF.

In contrast to previous revolutions in technology and work, the professions are more vulnerable to impact and change from artificial intelligence.  At the same time, the ‘cognitive-task-oriented jobs’ will need to navigate using artificial intelligence more than others.

This online symposium will bring together academics, practitioners, researchers and others to discuss what generative AI means for the professions and for professional ethics.

Possible topics of interest include:

  * What does AI mean for the professions?
  * What ethical issues are posed by the potential disruptions to the professions?
  * What does AI mean for professional ethics?
  * What impact will AI have on education and training pathways for aspiring professionals as well as those already in the professions?
  * What does the public have a right to expect of the professions with respect to AI?
  * What does AI mean for the role of specialist knowledge in the professions?

The AAPAE invites abstracts of 500-1,000 words on these and related topics, to be submitted by 7th November 2024 together with a short biography of the presenter/s (up to 100 words).
