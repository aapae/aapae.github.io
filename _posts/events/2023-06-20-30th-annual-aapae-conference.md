> Applied Ethics Stream at the AAP 2023 Conference<br>

> The Mary Glowrey Building, 115 Victoria Parade, Fitzroy Vic 3065<br>

The theme is: Power, Inequality, and Accountability

For good or ill, power suffuses almost every facet of the contemporary world: industry, law, government, employment, information technology, and even social interactions. The inequalities and injustices that can stem from power are increasingly visible. But just as power can create and entrench inequalities (by design or by accident), it can be used to confront and rectify them. Accountability is key for ensuring power is used within ethical constraints, and for socially justified purposes. But there are major challenges to making the exercise of power accountable—and to ensure the mechanisms of accountability are not themselves corrupted.

This applied ethics stream will explore the ethical challenges and philosophical questions arising from these topics, including:

* How can power be held accountable—on scales both small and large?
* How does power morally inter-relate with inequality?
* What types of inequalities are morally invidious, and what types are acceptable?
* What types of power relationships are legitimate and even morally necessary?
* What is the relationship between political concepts of equality and authority, and interpersonal moral obligations?

The Stream welcomes all applied ethics papers looking to explore these and similar themes. To help offset the AAP Conference fees, existing AAPAE Members presenting or attending the Stream will be granted free 2024 AAPAE membership.
