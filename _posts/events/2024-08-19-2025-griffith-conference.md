The AAPAE and the Australian Earth Laws Alliance (AELA) are co-hosting an exciting national conference in May 2025 in Brisbane, exploring how we can build ethical futures in a rapidly changing world. In a time of rapid and uncertain social, economic and environmental change and disruption, we must build creative visions for our future, applying principled and ethical decision-making and action.

> Conference theme: Ethical Futures for People and Planet
> Thursday 1st to Saturday 3rd May 2025,
> Griffith University EcoCentre, Nathan Campus, Building N68, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan QLD 4111

The AAPAE/AELA Conference will explore themes including the following:

* Indigenous ethics, decision-making and governance systems
* Earth-centred ethics, law and governance.
* The role of ethics in the future of private sector and corporate governance
* Ethical attention to place and relationship with local culture and environment in a changing world
* The significance of care as an ongoing moral response
* The connections between ethics, spirituality and earth care
* Navigating green-on-green ethical challenges (such as in the intersection of eco-values between conservation and renewable energy production)
* Changes to ethics and values that we need, to ensure a safe and livable future.

The 2025 conference will focus on these and related questions. Papers that explore the AAPAEâ€™s area of interest in other areas of applied and professional ethics are also, as always, very welcome. The Call for Papers will be announced in August, and key timelines will be shared in August/September.
