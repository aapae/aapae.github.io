The AAPAE Ethics Olympiad will be held via Zoom on the 5th of October 2023.  Graduate and Undergraduate University students are invited to enter teams to represent their tertiary institution. Any tertiary institution can participate, but there is a maximum of two teams from each institution allowed to enter. During the day, all will be involved in a series of three heats where they will be scored according to set criteria that rewards, clear, concise, respectful discourse around interesting ethical cases. Gold, Silver and Bronze medals will be awarded to the top three teams. For more information, [see here](https://ethicsolympiad.org/?page_id=1458)!

### About the Ethics Olympiad

The Ethics Olympiad provides schools and tertiary institutions with a unique opportunity to develop skills in critical thinking, collaboration and communication. It is designed to get students thinking, talking and ultimately working together on some of the tough moral issues of our time. Our objective is to do more than just help them think through ethical issues: It is to guide students on how to think through ethical issues together, as fellow citizens in a complex moral and political community.

Age-appropriate and interesting ethical cases are released each year and these are provided to coaches before the event. We use Zoom to bring the teams together on the day and so all you need is access to the internet.

At an Ethics Olympiad, the competitors (‘Eth-letes’) build and critique their own and others arguments as they respond to a question. How they respond to the question is completely up to them. Participants report that they enjoy the opportunity this format provides building arguments with each other in a framework that encourages careful considered responses to important ethical issues. They like the fact that they can agree with other teams and that it is very different to a debate. A variety of Tertiary trained judges work with the teams on the day to assist them in the process of coming to the best possible answers.
