## ‘Social licence and ethical practice’

Wednesday 11 – Friday 13 August  
Online Conference via Zoom 

The idea of the ‘social licence to operate’ (‘SLO’) first arose late last century in application to mining industries. Local communities judged that industries were causing too much environmental harm or social disruption, and they began resisting and disrupting industry activities. The critics claimed that the industries had lost their ‘social licence’ to conduct their operations. 

Over the last twenty years, the SLO concept has been applied to many industries (e.g. paper mills, banking, tourism, aquaculture) and even to public works. In some applications, the invocation of the SLO concept seems to have had good results, strengthening industry ethical standards and encouraging genuine engagement with stakeholder communities. In others, the SLO concept has itself become the subject of ethical contestation.

The Conference will explore the many ethical questions raised by the notion of the SLO:

  - What is the relationship between the SLO and other more familiar ethical concepts like corporate social responsibility, triple bottom line and legitimacy?
  - How can the ‘community’ that grants the SLO be determined? Is this a practical or ethical question?
  - Should the SLO be employed more widely, as a way of improving industry standards and community engagement across more domains?
  - Should the SLO be resisted on ethical grounds, perhaps because of its inherent indeterminacy and unpredictability for industry—or because it distracts from more democratic and demanding governance/regulatory arrangements?
  - Is the SLO an entirely new form of governance regime or ethical standing, made possible through new technology and social media?

As always, generalist papers on any issues in professional and applied ethics are welcome at the AAPAE Conference. There will also be two streams on:

  1.  Professional ethics & professionalism  
  2.  Moral philosophers working outside philosophy departments
