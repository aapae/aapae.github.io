28th Annual Virtual Conference – 11th to 13th August 2021. Hosted by the [Law Futures Centre](https://www.griffith.edu.au/law-futures-centre) at Griffith University, Queensland
The theme will be ‘Social Licence and Ethical Practice’.

The AAPAE Conference Committee warmly invites submissions for the 28th Annual AAPAE Conference from individuals (and teams) from all disciplines and professions who are interested in advancing the understanding, teaching, and practice of professional and applied ethics. 

This year’s annual conference will be held online; however, the conference atmosphere will, as always, be one of collegiality and encouragement, and a great space for newbie researchers (as well as seasoned presenters) to showcase their work.  Attendees only are also warmly welcome.

Registration is now open and the registration form can be [downloaded here](/documents/2021-AAPAE-Conference-Registration.docx). Please email your completed form to Dr Hugh Breakey at [h.breakey@griffith.edu.au](mailto:h.breakey@griffith.edu.au) to express your interest to attend and obtain the conference link and password.
