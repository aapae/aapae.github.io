**The AAPAE is pleased to be working in partnership with AELA (Australian Earth Laws Alliance) to co-host an exciting national conference in May 2025 in Brisbane**

We live in a time of rapid social, economic and environmental change and disruption. Now more than ever we need to build creative visions for our future and apply principled and ethical decision making and action.

Over three days, the AAPAE and AELA will bring together people from diverse fields of work and research, to explore how we can build ethical futures in a changing world.

Who is this conference for? Everyone interested in exploring, discussing and sharing ideas about we can build a society that centres the health of the living world, and our human communities.

### CONFERENCE THEMES

Proposals are invited to address one or more of the following conference themes:

* First Nations ethics, governance and decision making: de-colonised futures and representations.
* Our ethical obligations to the non-human world: ecocentric governance, rights of nature, earth laws, bioregionalism and human-nature relationships.
* Technologies of the future for environments of the future: ethical challenges and promises.
* Caring for others while caring for the planet: the ethical challenges and potential harms of altruism.
* Whose job is it anyway? Markets, grassroots movements, regulation and law: The role of the private sector, community and governments in building an ethical future.
* Everyday ethics â€“ changes to ethics and values to ensure, and adapt to, a safe, integrated and livable future.
