Over the past 20 years, large institutions-be they corporations or government agencies-have developed, via the collection and use of big data sets, a remarkable ability to track and predict individual and group behaviours. The techniques are impressive and, furthermore, give rise, especially in the health arena, to many potential benefits. At the same time, there is growing unease about both (i) the surveillance this seems to involve and (ii) the growing potential for extensive manipulation of the public at large. In this conference we would like to explore, amongst other things, the ethical implications of Big Data for us as a society and for professionals working with such data sets.

  *   What, if anything, is wrong with Big Data?  Are there genuine reasons for concern?
  *   Does Big Data represent an unacceptable form of surveillance that threatens our freedom in a significant way?
  *   What obligations might professionals working with Big Data have with respect to the obtaining of such information and the use to which this data is put?
  *   From a historical point of view, what distinguishes this system of data collection from earlier systems of collection? Is there something morally significant about any such differences?
  *   What limits might there be to the collection of such data?

The Conference Committee also warmly invites submissions from individuals (and teams) from all disciplines and professions who are interested in advancing the understanding, teaching, and practice of professional and applied ethics. The annual conference atmosphere will, as always, be one of collegiality and encouragement, and a great space for newbie researchers (as well as seasoned presenters) to showcase their work.

Keynote speakers

 *   Dr Angela Daly, (University of Strathclyde, Glasgow)
 *   Professor Tony Coady (University of Melbourne)
 *   Professor Moira Paterson (Monash University)
