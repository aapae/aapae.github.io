### 6th Annual Australasian Business Ethics Network (ABEN) Symposium 
BUSINESS ETHICS THEORY in PRACTICE 
Griffith University, Southbank, Brisbane December 5 and 6, 2016.

Supported by Griffith University – Griffith Centre for Sustainable Enterprise and International Business and Asian Studies Department 

### Call for Papers
Abstract and Full Paper Submission Deadline: 31 July 2016.

Submissions are now being invited for the 6th annual ABEN Symposium on Business Ethics (www.aben.org.au).  The conference will begin on the evening of 4 December with a meet and greet.

Sessions for the delivery of papers will run on the 5 and 6 December.

The ABEN conference brings academics, critics, and practitioners together to discuss and debate the nature, intent, effects, and futures of business ethics in Australasia and beyond.  It is a key forum in the region for reflective, engaged, and philosophical work on business ethics.  The location for this year’s conference is at Griffith University.  The conference is linked with publication opportunities in business ethics and is very inclusive.  We welcome submissions that explore business ethics from a range of theoretical, empirical, and practical positions and perspectives.

This year, the theme is Business Ethics Theory in Practice.  We are seeking to promote the link between theoretical developments in ethics and their application to a broad array of practical contexts.

We thus invite papers that aim to articulate new approaches to moral judgments in business practice here and now, in globalized and diverse contexts.  We also encourage the submission of papers that question, critique, support or encourage the role that businesses can or do play in making a genuine positive difference to sustainability and the reduction of human and social suffering.

The ABEN symposium is taking place before the ANZAM Conference 2016, which is being held in Brisbane from 6 to 9 December 2016 (http://www.anzam.org/).

If you wish to make a submission for presentation at the ABEN Conference, please send a 500-word abstract, as an email attachment, to Heather Stewart at ABEN2016@griffith.edu.au by 31 July 2016.

Full papers may also be submitted, to be peer reviewed, if required by your funding institution.
