### Call for Papers

Australian Association of Professional and Applied Ethics

### AAPAE 2016 Annual Conference

Adelaide
15 – 17 June 2016
School of Management
University of South Australia

Conference theme:

### * Responsible Leadership and Ethical Decision-Making

AAPAE’s mission is to foster awareness of applied ethics as a significant area of concern in organizations and society. It serves as a meeting point for practitioners from various fields faced with ethical challenges in organisational life and academics with specialist expertise in the areas of professional and applied ethics. It welcomes contributions from all disciplines and areas, including business ethics, bioethics, legal ethics, medical ethics, media ethics, neuro ethics, political ethics, and sports ethics. AAPAE aims at promoting a climate in which different and differing views, concerns, and approaches can be expressed and discussed in a collaborative environment.

The AAPAE 2016 annual conference will be held in Adelaide and hosted by the University of South Australia. The overarching conference theme will be 'Responsible Leadership and Ethical Decision-Making', two interconnected areas which have seen a surge of research activities in recent years. 

There is an emerging consensus that a key challenge for responsible leaders is to build and cultivate sustainable relationships with stakeholders, whether in business, politics, or other parts of society. Rather than a preconceived construct or predefined remedy to leadership failure and organizational ills, responsible leadership is seen emerging as a multilevel theory that connects individual, organizational, and institutional factors, including values, virtues, and ethical decision-making on the individual level; the interplay of social responsibility, stakeholder theory, and leadership on the organizational level; as well as contextual factors such as power distance, collectivism, and humane orientation that indicate the extent to which social concerns are part of cultural practices.

Papers on the general theme of 'Responsible Leadership and Ethical Decision-Making' are encouraged but submissions from all relevant disciplines and perspectives are welcomed, including:

•	Behavioural ethics
•	Business ethics
•	Bioethics
•	Ethical constructs (e.g., moral intuition)
•	Teaching applied ethics
•	Ethical challenges in the 21st century
•	Media ethics
•	Academic Integrity
•	Ethics, sustainability and CSR
•	The role of emotions in ethical decision-making

The conference will start with a function in UniSA’s Kerry Packer Gallery on 15th June 2016. Keynote speakers, presentations and panel discussions will be on 16 and 17 June. A conference dinner in one of Adelaide’s many great restaurants is scheduled for the evening of 16 June. Keynote speakers will be announced shortly.
