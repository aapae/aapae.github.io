## Ethics in Management: Business and the Professions

The AAPAE Conference Committee warmly invites submissions for the 29th Annual AAPAE Conference from individuals (and teams) from all disciplines and professions who are interested in advancing the understanding, teaching, and practice of professional and applied ethics.  This yearâ€™s annual conference will be held online; however, the conference atmosphere will, as always, be one of collegiality and encouragement, and a great space for newbie researchers (as well as seasoned presenters) to showcase their work.  Attendees only are also warmly welcome.

Please email the completed form to Dr Jacqui Boaks at jacqueline.boaks@curtin.edu.au to express your interest to attend and obtain the conference link and password.
