Call for papers
CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN ...
The AAPAE Conference Committee warmly invites submissions for the 22nd Annual AAPAE Conference from individuals (and teams) from all disciplines and professions who are interested in advancing the understanding, teaching, and practice of professional and applied ethics.  The annual conference atmosphere is one of collegiality and encouragement, and is a great space for newbie researchers (as well as seasoned presenters) to showcase their work.

The conference will have both a refereed and non-refereed stream.  Refereed track papers are to be submitted consistent with the author guidelines (see below).  Authors are also asked to provide a short biography of no more than 100 words and an abstract of no more than 200 words when they submit their paper. Non-refereed track papers should be submitted in the form of an abstract of no more than 350 words, as well as a short biography of no more than 100 words. 

Submissions for both streams should reach the conference convenor email: 2015AAPAEConference@auckland.ac.nz no later than 15 May 2015.
