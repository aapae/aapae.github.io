## Call for papers:

## 2015 Australian Association for Professional & Applied Ethics (AAPAE) Annual Conference

### 09-12 July, The University of Auckland

http://2015aapaeconference.blogspot.co.nz/p/home.html

The conference theme, "Contemporary issues in...",  is designed to give professionals, academics, and postgraduate students the opportunity to present work and discuss issues in the areas of applied and professional ethics. It provides a meeting point for practitioners from various fields and academics with specialist expertise and welcomes everyone who wants or needs to think and talk about applied or professional ethics.

The opening address will be given by Prof Tim Mulgan (Auckland/St Andrews) on the evening of Thursday, 9 July. On the evening of Saturday, 11 July, Associate Professor Hilary Greaves (Oxford) will give the second keynote, followed by a catered social gathering to which conference guests are warmly invited.

Registration for the 2015 AAPAE Annual Conference is now open. You may attend as a presenter or without presenting a paper. Presenters may choose between 30-minute and 45-minute long slots.


The AAPAE has a standing arrangement with the journal *Research in Ethical Issues in Organizations* (REIO) to publish selected papers from the AAPAE Annual Conference. Participants of the 2015 conference are strongly encouraged to submit their paper for publication in REIO.

The preliminary deadline for submitting abstracts (with titles) is 17 May 2015.

Please note that you may only submit one paper. If we still have open presentation slots after the specified deadline, we will be happy to accept further submissions. Priority at that point will be given to first papers; after that, we will be open to accepting second papers from authors at our discretion.

There will be a combined workshop on 'Role Anxieties: Contemporary and Antiquarian Perspectives' with the participants of the Annual Meeting of the Pacific Rim Roman Literature Seminar that is hosted by Classics and Ancient History at the University of Auckland this year.
