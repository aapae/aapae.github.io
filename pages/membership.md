## An Invitation

Interested persons are invited to join the AAPAE to become part of this expanding network of professionals, academics, teachers, business people and commentators in all fields of applied and professional ethics: business, criminal justice, journalism, law, medicine, nursing, public policy, and many more. 

The Association aims to inform you about current events, conferences and publications. It is in the vanguard of developments in this emerging and exciting field of intellectual endeavour. The AAPAE will be pleased to put you in touch with others who share your particular interests, and help you to publicise your conferences and other events in the applied ethics field.

## Why join?

Membership includes:

- The Association's newsletter, _Australian Ethics_, published twice each year.
- Discounted registration fee at the Annual National Conference
- Discounted hardcopy of the edited AAPAE Conference Proceedings volume of Research in Ethics in Organisations (REIO). REIO is available online through Emerald Group Publishing.

Also, you are welcome to sign up to our email list (see below) if you haven't already. You needn't be a member to sign up to this list.
 

## How to join?

Membership of the AAPAE is open to individuals and institutions. Membership fees for 2017 are --

- $90 individuals
- $200 institutions
- $25 concession: students and low income
